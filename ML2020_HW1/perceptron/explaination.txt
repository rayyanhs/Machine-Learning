Perceptron code description:
> Find the number of training examples
> initialize the weight vector for the perceptron with zeros.
> set the learning weights to zero
> define a list to store the errors
> Define a variable that will store the value of w that gives the least error
> A variable to store the smallest error
> Iterate n times over the whole data set.
> Iterate over each sample in the data set
> Misclassification condition yi⟨xi,w⟩≤0 
> Update rule for the weights w=w+yi∗xi including the learning rate


Logistic Regression:
For logistic regression the LogisticRegression module from sklearn is used.
To learn the model you need to use the  fit(...)  instruction
and to predict you need to use the  predict(...)  function.ss
